Made a visitor that typechekcs a MiniJava program.

Main file is called Typecheck.java, and if P.java contains a program to be type checked, then:

java Typecheck < P.java

should print either "Program type checked successfully" or "Type error".

The MiniJava language description and type rules are available on "MiniJava Type System.pdf".
